# WebProjects
In this repository ill be collecting all my web project that ill be doing even if they are make by me or by using full stack tutorials and in ths "README" ill bee giving a brief description and what tech i've used. 
For the record "VehicleProject" is not my first project, but the first that i would feel comfortable sharing on my github page; i've make 2 more apps in the past ( one simple php store manager and a Booking.com clone app witch i havent't finished). The reason that i haven't included those 2, it was that they were too messy to understand.
1)VehicleProject -this one is my first project in a while and also the first to show in my repository; it consists of a simple app for adds on cars, nothing fancy; the tech used was MERN
